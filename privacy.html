        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: September 1, 2025</p>
        
        <p>At Converter, we deeply value the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and disclosed by Converter.</p>

        <h2>Local Image Processing (Client-Side)</h2>
        <p>It is important to understand that <strong>Converter processes all your images locally within your web browser</strong>. This means:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No Server Uploads:</strong> The images you upload to our converter never leave your device and are never sent to our servers or any third-party.</li>
            <li><strong>Your Data Stays With You:</strong> We do not access, store, or retain any copies of your original images or the converted images.</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum Privacy:</strong> Because the entire conversion process happens on your device, your data privacy and security are fully maintained.</li>
            <li><strong>Camera/Storage Permissions:</strong> We do not request or access your device's camera or storage without your explicit consent (e.g., when you manually select a file through a standard upload dialog).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Because Converter operates entirely client-side (in the browser), we <strong>do not directly collect any personal identifying information</strong> from you, including your name, email address, or other identifiable details.</p>
        
        <h2>Log Data</h2>
        <p>Like many site operators, we may collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our site ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, and other statistics. This information is used for general analytics and service improvement.</p>

        <h2>Cookies and Google AdSense</h2>
        <p>We use Google AdSense to display advertisements on our site. Google AdSense may use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to this or other sites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and/or other sites on the Internet.
          <ul>
            <li>You may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google's Ad Settings</a>.</li>

          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
